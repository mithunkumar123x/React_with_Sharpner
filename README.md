you have 100 expenses you would have to write ExpenseItems Component 100 times. 

{use of .map to write js in html tag.}

Making Components Smaller and Readable.

 I've used LocationOfExpenditure.map to dynamically render each location based on your array.

Manipulating the DOM - REACT STATES : 
 add a button next to each expense which changes expense to 100$ whenever we click on it.Use same logic as change title.

Creating my  own first Component : 

 [Only when the form is visible on the screen try this] - Whenever the user types anything on the screen anything on the form show that in console.log .You simply have to use vanilla JS. - 'onChange' and event object

 Add two way binding : this is useful on form submission
 add setuserInput and add value in input tag.
